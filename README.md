# Weather Forecast Evaluation

## Objective
The aim of the project is to collect weather forecast data along with historical data, store them in different databases (SQL and NoSQL) and compare the results, evaluate the forecasts.
The project itself aims to be automated, meaning that scheduled data pipelines with extract, transform and load functionalities have to be set up.
Data warehousing is also part of the project with advanced queries.
